        <h5><strong>!!Please Note!!</strong></h5>
        <em>We have had a few reports of someone calling about a door prize.<br>
        The Hammonton Rotary did not sponsor a door prize this year.<br>
        If you receive this phone call claiming you won a prize, it was an independant Vendor.<br>
        This vendor misrepresented himself and will not be welcomed back to any future events.<br>
        We appologize if you signed up with this vendor under the falsehood of being a door prize.<br>
        We are a Non-Profit organization that prides ourself on integrity. <br>
        If you wish to get in contact with the Vendor and ask to be removed from any of his list, feel free to bombard his inbox <a href="mailto:larrythomasjr@rcn.com">larrythomasjr@rcn.com</a>
